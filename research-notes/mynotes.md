\## Notes on worms:



-Not like phishing where it requires a victim present



-Relies on hidden and known computer system vulnerabilities that were not patched on the initial deployment of the malware



-Uses the host computer as a point of attack, duplicates copies of itself for future attacks



-Attacks other computers in the network the host computer is in, and grows exponentially with more computers being infected with the worm.
