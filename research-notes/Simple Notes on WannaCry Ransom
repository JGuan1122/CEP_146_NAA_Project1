#Simple Notes on WannaCry Ransom

##what is it?
- WannaCry is a type of **"ransomware"**.Simply put, it's bad piece of software.
- It will sneak into your computer or phone,then lock your files(such as photos, documents, videos) so you can't open them.

##How does it affect people?
- After your files are locked, a message will pop up on the screen. It will ask you to pay a certain amount of money (usually with an online currency called "Bitcoin") to get the password to unlock the files.
- Many people feel worried because their important files are locked—like work documents or family photos.
- In the past, it affected many places, such as computers in schools, hospitals, and companies. This made it impossible for them to work normally.

##How does it get into a computer?
- The most common way is through "vulnerabilities" in the computer system (these are small unfixed problems in the system). It sneaks in through these vulnerabilities.
- Sometimes, if you click on strange email attachments or visit unsafe websites, it can also get into your computer.

##How to protect yourself?
- Update your computer system in time: When your computer prompts you to update, do it as soon as possible. This fixes vulnerabilities and keeps it out.
- Don’t click on unfamiliar attachments in emails: If you don’t know the sender, or if the attachment looks strange, don’t open it.
Back up important files: Save important things like photos and documents to a USB drive, external hard drive, or a safe online storage service (such as a regular cloud drive). That way, even if your computer is locked, you won’t lose your files.
- Install antivirus software: Choose a reliable antivirus program to help block this bad software.

##What to do if you accidentally encounter it?
- Don’t rush to pay! Many times, even if you pay, the other side won’t give you the unlock password—they’ll just trick your money.
- Turn off your computer as soon as possible, then ask someone who knows about computers for help (like a computer repair person) to see if they can recover your files.
- Tell your family or colleagues at work. Let them check their computers too, to avoid everyone being affected together.
